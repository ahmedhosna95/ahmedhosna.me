If you are subscribed to my [newsletter](https://alexcarpenter.me/newsletter/) or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hybrid_alex), you probably have noticed my excitement for the new static site generator [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/). This very site you are reading is built with Eleventy, and my recent side project [Front-end Foundations](https://frontend-foundations.com/) is built with it as well.

After a few times recreating my ideal folder structure and configuration, I figured it was time to create a boilerplate to get up and running quickly for future projects. So I created my slightly opinionated Eleventy boilerplate.

It is purposely simple, using [Nunjchuks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) as a templating language, and following some of the [quick tips](https://www.11ty.io/docs/quicktips/) to inline minified [CSS](https://www.11ty.io/docs/quicktips/inline-css/) and [JavaScript](https://www.11ty.io/docs/quicktips/inline-js/). I have found this to be a quite enjoyable setup for personal projects and getting a prototype up and running quickly to share with a team when paired with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

Feel free to check the project out on [Github](https://github.com/alexcarpenter/eleventy-boilerplate) and let me know what you think!

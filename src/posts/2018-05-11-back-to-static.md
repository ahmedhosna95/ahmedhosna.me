title: Back to static
summary: Towards the beginning of the year I had migrated my personal site setup from Jekyll over to Craft CMS.

Around that time I was interested in improving my Craft CMS development skills, so it made sense to use my website as a playground to learn.

Since then, I have learned a lot and made a few [screencasts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSXglzqJ2Z4&list=PLmv4wIIvTDgGX6bpR3cdVddTDTR8DbDmO) along the way. That time spent learning and experimenting has had a big influence on how I approach new Craft CMS builds these days, success!

Lately I have been feeling the itch to get back to something simpler and lighter. I had seen Zach Leatherman had released [Eleventy](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy) recently, which is an alternative to Jekyll built on Javascript.

After roughly a week of setup, design/development and content migration, I have a new site setup. I really like the flexibity <abbr title="Eleventy">11ty</abbr> offers in comparision to my previous Jekyll build. <abbr title="Eleventy">11ty</abbr> manages my content and templates and I bring my own styling and scripting layers.

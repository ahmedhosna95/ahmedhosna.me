Back when I was hosting the [I Brew My Own Coffee podcast](http://www.ibrewmyowncoffee.com/) – I had crowd-sourced a list of US Coffee Roasters from a Reddit thread and piped that data into a spreadsheet. Last week I happened across that spreadsheet again and I thought I'd make a little site so folks could have access to the data.

I had just updated my [eleventy-boilerplate](https://github.com/alexcarpenter/eleventy-boilerplate), so it was a great opportunity to give it a shot from start to finish with the new setup.

<mark>In less than 10 minutes I had the data converted to JSON and output within the template grouped by state.</mark> With a little bit of styling I was able to launch the site using Netlify in a matter of hours. I love how these tools empower me to build and launch ideas with minimal effort/overhead.

Check out the site at [us-coffee-roasters.com](https://us-coffee-roasters.com) and feel free to [submit a roaster](https://github.com/alexcarpenter/us-coffee-roasters/issues/new) if you don't see it on the list.
